Static site generated via freezing Flask.
Deployed with Netlify.

For this very simple site, absolute minimalism was my goal. This site serves as a miniature bio and a launch site for anyone looking to learn more about me.

I decided on Flask for the ability to update things completely on the fly and statically. Instead of an intense JS site, I chose a completely minimal and extremely simplified style. Netlify makes deploying extremely fast and simple, and requires nothing extra on my end, not even a command!

Minimalist Flask + HTML however has proved to be a poor platform for photography showcasing, and my next update will be making this much cleaner.
